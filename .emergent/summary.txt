The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive static landing page for Alesium based on iterative user feedback, implementing complex UI/UX features. Initially, a static HTML/CSS/JS site was generated and validated. A significant challenge involved integrating this static content within the existing React application structure to ensure it displayed correctly on the preview URL, which required modifying  to dynamically load the HTML. Subsequent phases focused on refining the design, incorporating auto-scrolling/draggable carousels, adopting specific color palettes (including Petralithe.com and Gracz.fr inspirations), adding parallax effects, integrating a custom FAQ, and overhauling the contact form to remove third-party dependencies. The engineer diligently addressed bugs, like the initial display issue and the FAQ visibility, and continuously enhanced visual elements like contrast, textures, and button styles. The latest work involves re-introducing a background image, fixing a contact form POST error, and adjusting the global color scheme.

The user tasked the AI engineer with creating a conversion-optimized MVP landing page for Alesium, an industrial expertise company. The page needed to embody agency-quality design, incorporate specific visual elements like z-index hierarchy, glass-morphism, distinct CTA sections, and emotional impact. The initial build involved generating a static HTML/CSS/JS site from provided assets, featuring a project carousel, project detail views (SPA-like), a contact section with a Tally iframe, and a responsive design.

Subsequent iterations included:
- Fixing the site's display when deployed (it was showing the default React app).
- Enhancing the profile photo visibility.
- Implementing an auto-scrolling and manually draggable project carousel.
- Applying a modern 2025 color palette with soft tones and rounded borders for sections.
- Reordering sections (projects below Qui je suis).
- Adding a subtle header texture and increasing specific contrast elements.
- Adapting the sophisticated, organic, and layered design aesthetic from  (parallax, spaced typography, overlays).
- Integrating a collapsible FAQ section inspired by , globally darkening the ambiance, and adding inter-section parallax.
- Replacing a green watermark with an  image (with opacity).
- Adding a phone number to the contact section.
- Applying a fine uniform texture across the entire site and refining button/form contrasts and sizes.
- Replacing the Tally contact form with a custom-built one inspired by , removing horizontal parallax, establishing inter-section parallax from -30% to 0%, and removing the être rappelé section.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **React Frontend**: Main application framework for dynamic content.
- **FastAPI Backend**: Python web framework for API services (minimal interaction in trajectory).
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database (backend uses for ).
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for the static site components and their dynamic enhancements.
- **Glassmorphism**: UI trend using blur and transparency.
- **Parallax Scrolling**: Visual effect where background content moves at a different speed than foreground content.

The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.



-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: This file is the central point for rendering the Alesium site. Initially, it was a default React app. It was **heavily modified** to dynamically load and render the HTML content of the static Alesium site (from ). This change was crucial to make the static content visible via the React development server and preview URL, resolving an early bug. It also orchestrates the loading of associated CSS and JavaScript for the static site.
-   **/app/frontend/public/index.html**: This is the main HTML file of the statically generated Alesium site. It defines the page structure, sections (hero, qui je suis, projets, tarifs, contact, FAQ), and links to the site's custom CSS and JavaScript. This file is parsed and injected into the React .
-   **/app/frontend/public/assets/css/app.css**: This CSS file contains the core styling for the Alesium site. It was **extensively modified** throughout the development to implement specific design choices: custom colors, typography (spaced text), glassmorphism effects for navigation and project cards, section-specific backgrounds and borders, header textures, button contrast enhancements, and the styles for the new Gracz-inspired contact form and FAQ. It also contains rules for parallax effects and responsive design.
-   **/app/frontend/public/assets/js/app.js**: This JavaScript file handles the dynamic behaviors of the Alesium static site. It was **repeatedly modified** to implement the auto-scrolling and draggable project carousel, the collapsible FAQ functionality (Gracz style), and the inter-section parallax effects. It also handles the logic for opening project details as a Single Page Application (SPA) routing.
-   **/app/docs/content/projets.json**: A JSON file generated from the user's project descriptions. It stores structured data for each project, including slug, title, description, key points, results, time spent, and technologies. This file is dynamically loaded by the frontend to populate the project carousel and detailed views.
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: This FastAPI file defines the backend API endpoints. While the focus has been on the frontend, this file provides a basic  (hello world) and  (create/get status checks) endpoint. The current Cannot POST / error for the contact form indicates a need to implement a corresponding backend endpoint for form submission or to correctly configure the frontend to send data to an existing one.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Re-integrate the workshop photo in the hero section, cropped to 21:9 or 32:9 format, with 20% opacity.
-   Fix the contact form submission issue, which currently returns Cannot POST /.
-   Darken the entire site's color palette by 30% using 's color scheme.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The Alesium landing page is currently a highly customized and feature-rich static site, dynamically loaded and managed by a React wrapper.

**Key features implemented so far:**
-   **Header & Navigation**: Features glassmorphism with transparency, elegant typography, and updated links to reordered sections. The header is now a clean, very dark green ( to ) without the previous watermark.
-   **Hero Section**: Presently a clean, very dark green background, but the user has requested the workshop image to be reintroduced.
-   **Section Reordering**: Sections are now ordered as Qui je suis -> Projets -> Positionnement -> Tarifs -> FAQ -> Contact.
-   **Qui je suis Section**: Features a visible profile photo (fixed from a previous bug), elegant spaced typography, and organic overlays with subtle textures.
-   **Project Carousel**: Located directly below Qui je suis. It's auto-scrolling, manually draggable (though reported as unstable during testing due to auto-animation), displays 12 duplicated cards (6 original projects sorted 1-6), and features glassmorphism cards with depth effects. Project details open directly beneath the carousel (SPA-like routing).
-   **Global Design**: Incorporates elements from  (parallax effects, spaced typography, organic textures, generous spacing) and  (FAQ and contact form design). The site has a subtle, fine uniform texture applied globally.
-   **FAQ Section**: A collapsible FAQ section (5 questions) inspired by 's clean design, complete with circular icons and smooth animations, is present and functional.
-   **Contact Section**: The previous Tally iframe has been completely replaced with a custom-built contact form inspired by . It includes fields for Name, Email, Phone, Subject (with a dropdown for Alesium services), and Message. The Être rappelé section and button have been removed. The contact information (Email, Maxence Pereira's phone number: 06 74 24 43 14) is clearly displayed.
-   **Parallax**: Inter-section parallax (sections moving -30% to 0% with opacity transitions) has been implemented, replacing the previous horizontal parallax.
-   **Visual Enhancements**: Significant adjustments to color palette (initially soft 2025 colors, then specific green/beige/copper, then a 20% global darkening), enhanced button contrast (e.g., Démarrer un échange), rounded borders for sections, and subtle shadows.

**Current Unresolved Issues/Pending Work**:
-   The hero section's background image (workshop photo) needs to be re-added as requested by the user, cropped to 21:9 or 32:9 with 20% opacity.
-   The custom contact form's submission currently results in a Cannot POST / error, indicating a lack of a proper backend endpoint or incorrect form action.
-   The overall site ambiance needs to be further darkened by 30% using the  color palette.
